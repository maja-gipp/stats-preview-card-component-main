# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

This is a project from the Frontend Mentor website that I have used many times to improve my front-end skills by building real projects. I was solving real-world HTML, CSS and JavaScript challenges whilst working with professional designs. Frontend Mentor provides designs so that you can practice your front-end skills using a real-life workflow. My challenge here was to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. This was a great small challenge. There’s no JS in this project, so I was most focused on HTML & CSS skills. Here you can see the final look of my project and the one from the website.

Why only one commit?

Because its’s just a final state of the commits I did privately during learning and now I am cleaning up this code and applying my latest knowledge so you can see the final version of the project soon :)
